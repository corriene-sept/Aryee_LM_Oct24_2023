*This document shows how I made this github repository.*

## Make a repo

>- Initialize a new github repository
>- Clone the github repository 

*Before running the below code, I made a new github repository on my github*

*This code is now cloning my new github repository to the cluster, where I can add in RMD files and make changes before pushing those changes back to github.*
```{bash,  eval = FALSE}
cd /aryeelab/users/corri/Oct24_Presentation/ # directory I want to clone the github into
git clone https://github.com/corriene-sept/Aryee_LM_Oct24_2023.git # clone github
cd Aryee_LM_Oct24_2023 # change directory to github folder
```

## Make your first RMD file

*First make a directory to put your figures in*
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
cd /aryeelab/users/corri/Oct24_Presentation/Aryee_LM_Oct24_2023/
mkdir Figures # going to store figures here
pwd
```

**Make the RMD file and knit it before pushing the changes to github. Note that if you make changes to the RMD file and forget to knit, these changes will not show up in the MD file.**

## Push changes to github
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
cd /aryeelab/users/corri/Oct24_Presentation/Aryee_LM_Oct24_2023
ls # Example_RMD.md   Figures    README.Rmd Example_RMD.Rmd  README.md

git add . # add files
git commit -m "Add files" # commit the files, and include a message

# check that commit was successful
#git log
git cherry -v # check commit

git branch # check which branch we're on
git pull https://github.com/corriene-sept/Aryee_LM_Oct24_2023.git main # pull changes from github
git push https://github.com/corriene-sept/Aryee_LM_Oct24_2023.git main # push changes to github
```
